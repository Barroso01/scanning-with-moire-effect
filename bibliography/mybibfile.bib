abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) phase unwrapping continues to find applications in a wide variety of scientific and engineering areas including optical and microwave interferometry, adaptive optics, compensated imaging, and synthetic-aperture-radar phase correction, and image processing. We have developed a robust method (not based on any path-following scheme) for unwrapping 2D phase principal values (in a least-squares sense) by using fast cosine transforms. If the 2D phase values are associated with a 2D weighting, the fast transforms can still be used in iterative methods for solving the weighted unwrapping problem. Weighted unwrapping can be used to isolate inconsistent regions (i.e., phase shear) in an elegant fashion.},

abstract = {A new algorithm is proposed for unwrapping interferometric phase maps. Existing algorithms search the two-dimensional spatial domain for 2$\pi$ discontinuities: only one phase map is required, but phase errors can propagate outward from regions of high noise, corrupting the rest of the image. An alternative approach based on one-dimensional unwrapping along the time axis is proposed. It is applicable to an important subclass of interferometry applications, in which a sequence of incremental phase maps can be obtained leading up to the final phase-difference map of interest. A particular example is quasi-static deformation analysis. The main advantages are (i) it is inherently simple, (ii) phase errors are constrained within the high-noise regions, and (iii) phase maps containing global discontinuities are unwrapped correctly, provided the positions of the discontinuities remain fixed with time. The possibility of real-time phase unwrapping is also discussed.},

abstract = {A multilevel quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm for real-time 3D shape measurement is presented. The quality map is generated from the gradient of the phase map. Multilevel thresholds are used to unwrap the phase level by level. Within the data points in each level, a fast scan-line algorithm is employed. The processing time of this algorithm is approximately18.3 ms for an image size of640{\texttimes}480 pixels in an ordinary computer. We demonstrate that this algorithm can be implemented into our real-time 3D shape measurement system for real-time 3D reconstruction. Experiments show that this algorithm improves the previous scan-line phase unwrapping algorithm significantly although it reduces its processing speed slightly.},

abstract = {A wide range of interferometric techniques recover phase information that is                mathematically wrapped on the interval (-$\pi$,$\pi$\] . Obtaining the                true unwrapped phase is a longstanding problem. We present an algorithm that solves                the phase unwrapping problem, using a combination of Fourier techniques. The                execution time for our algorithm is equivalent to the computation time required for                performing eight fast Fourier transforms and is stable against noise and residues                present in the wrapped phase. We have extended the algorithm to handle data of                arbitrary size. We expect the state of the art of existing interferometric                applications, including the possibility for real-time phase recovery, to benefit                from our algorithm.},
