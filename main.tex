    As of 2021, the digital revolution has shaped every industry thanks to the ever growing computational power accessible to the population. 
    Thus, being able to digitally extract and process data has become a key virtue in many business worldwide. 
    In this work, we aim to illustrate the working principles of a digital scanning technology called Moire by fringe displacement.
    The team shows that with a projector, camera and a computer; it is possible to measure the depth of a 3D system. 
    This has applications in diverse fields like: quality control, biomedical, archaeology and the fashion industry.
