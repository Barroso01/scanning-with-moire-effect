# Research Paper Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template for research papers. It includes a clean directory structure and pre-configured `.cls` and `.tex` files for producing professional two-column papers.

## Repository Structure
Template/ |-- Bibliography/ # Contains reference files | |-- references.bib # BibTeX bibliography file |-- Sections/ # Contains individual paper sections | |-- introduction.tex # Introduction section | |-- methods.tex # Methods section | |-- conclusion.tex # Conclusion section |-- document_layout.cls # Custom LaTeX class file for paper formatting |-- main.tex # Main LaTeX file |-- main.pdf # Output PDF of the compiled paper

## How to Compile
To compile the paper from the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Barroso01/paper-template.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
    cd paper-template

3. Follow the sequence to compile the LaTeX source code:
    ```bash
    pdflatex main.tex 
    bibtex main
    pdflatex main.tex
    pdflatex main.tex

The first command compiles the main.tex file, the second command runs BibTeX to generate the bibliography, and the third and fourth commands compile the main.tex file again to include the bibliography.
